</head>
<body>
    <h1>Restore Purchases Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This Restore Purchases Policy for Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text is effective as of February 21, 2025. It explains how users can restore in-app purchases made within the App. Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text requires users to log in using their Google or Facebook accounts, and all purchases are tied to these accounts. Please read this carefully to understand the process.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text offers optional in-app purchases (e.g., premium features or subscriptions) to enhance your experience. These purchases are tied to your Google Play account and linked through your Google or Facebook login. This policy outlines how you can restore access to these purchases if you reinstall the App, switch devices, or encounter other issues.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Restore functionality is available only for purchases made through Google Play within Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text. Purchases from other platforms or sources cannot be restored via this App.</li>
        <li>Purchases are linked to your Google Play account and associated with your Google or Facebook login used within the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. How to Restore Purchases</h3>
    <p>To restore your previous in-app purchases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Ensure you are signed into the same Google Play account used to make the original purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in to Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text using the same Google or Facebook account you used when making the purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open the App on your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Navigate to the [Settings/Purchase Menu – customize based on your UI] within the App.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap "Restore Purchases" to sync your purchase history with the App. This process is handled automatically by Google Play Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Wait a few moments for the restoration to complete. Your premium features or content should be reactivated without additional input from you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Since purchases are tied to your Google Play account and linked through your Google or Facebook login, ensure you are using the correct accounts for both.</p>

    <h3>3. Troubleshooting</h3>
    <p>If you encounter issues restoring your purchases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Connectivity:</strong> Ensure your device is connected to the internet, as restoration requires communication with Google Play Services.</li>
        <li><strong>Account Confirmation:</strong> Verify you are using the correct Google Play account and have logged in with the same Google or Facebook account used for the original purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Support:</strong> If the issue persists, you may contact us at:<br>
            <strong>Email:</strong> cosmicloopbyte@gmail.com<br>
            Include your Google Play Order ID (found in your purchase confirmation email or Google Play transaction history), the email associated with your Google or Facebook account (for verification purposes only), and a brief description of the problem (e.g., date of purchase). We will assist within 5 business days. Support is limited to coordinating with Google Play, as we do not store purchase data.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Non-Transferable:</strong> Purchases are tied to your Google Play account and the associated Google or Facebook login. They cannot be transferred to another account or device not linked to these accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Dependency:</strong> Restoration relies on Google Play’s systems. We cannot restore purchases if Google Play fails to verify them due to reasons beyond our control (e.g., account issues, policy violations).</li>
        <li><strong>No Refunds via Restoration:</strong> Restoring purchases reactivates access but does not affect refund eligibility. Refund requests must be directed to Google Play (<a href="[Google Play Refund Policy Link]">Google Play Refund Policy</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Account-Based System:</strong> Purchases are managed through your Google or Facebook login, and restoration is handled via Google Play Services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Post-Restoration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Successfully restored purchases will reactivate your premium features or content within the App.</li>
        <li>If you uninstall and reinstall the App, you must log in with the same Google or Facebook account and repeat the restoration process, as purchases are linked to your account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Important Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account-Based Usage:</strong> Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text requires users to log in using their Google or Facebook accounts. All purchase management is handled through these accounts and your Google Play account.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Play Responsibility:</strong> Transaction records and purchase verification are maintained by Google Play, not us. For issues beyond restoration (e.g., account deletion or payment disputes), refer to Google’s support (<a href="[Google Support Link]">Google Support</a>).</li>
        <li><strong>Minimal Data Collection:</strong> While we require Google or Facebook login, we collect and store only the necessary data to facilitate account linking and purchase restoration, in line with our privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>
