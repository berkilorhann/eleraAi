    <title>Restore Purchases Policy -  Elera AI:Chat,Talk,Text </title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Restore Purchases Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This Restore Purchases Policy for Elera AI:Chat,Talk,Text is effective as of February 21, 2025. It explains how users can restore in-app purchases made within the App. Since Elera AI:Chat,Talk,Text operates with an anonymous registration system and does not collect or store personal data, this policy reflects our minimal data handling approach. Please read this carefully to understand the process.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        Elera AI:Chat,Talk,Text offers optional in-app purchases (e.g., premium features or subscriptions) to enhance your experience. These purchases are tied to your Google Play account, as the App does not require traditional account creation or personal information. This policy outlines how you can restore access to these purchases if you reinstall the App, switch devices, or encounter other issues.

        <h3>1. Eligibility</h3>
        - Restore functionality is available only for purchases made through Google Play within [Your App Name]. Purchases from other platforms or sources cannot be restored via this App.<br>
        - As the App uses an anonymous system, purchases are linked solely to your Google Play account, not to any personal identifiers like email or User ID.

        <h3>2. How to Restore Purchases</h3>
        To restore your previous in-app purchases:<br>
        - <strong>Step 1:</strong> Ensure you are signed into the same Google Play account used to make the original purchase. The App relies on Google Play’s system to recognize your transactions.<br>
        - <strong>Step 2:</strong> Open [Your App Name] on your device.<br>
        - <strong>Step 3:</strong> Navigate to the [Settings/Purchase Menu – customize based on your UI] within the App.<br>
        - <strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap "Restore Purchases" to sync your purchase history with the App. This process is handled automatically by Google Play Services.<br>
        - <strong>Step 5:</strong> Wait a few moments for the restoration to complete. Your premium features or content should be reactivated without additional input from you.<br>
        Note: Since we do not collect personal data or manage accounts, no login or additional verification is required beyond your Google Play account.

        <h3>3. Troubleshooting</h3>
        If you encounter issues restoring your purchases:<br>
        - <strong>Check Connectivity:</strong> Ensure your device is connected to the internet, as restoration requires communication with Google Play Services.<br>
        - <strong>Account Confirmation:</strong> Verify you are using the correct Google Play account by checking your purchase history in the Google Play Store app.<br>
        - <strong>Optional Support:</strong> If the issue persists, you may contact us at:<br>
        <strong>Email:</strong> cosmicloopbyte@gmail.com<br>
        Include your Google Play Order ID (found in your purchase confirmation email or Google Play transaction history) and a brief description of the problem (e.g., date of purchase). We will assist within 5 business days, but note that we do not collect or store your personal information—support is limited to coordinating with Google Play.<br>
        - <strong>No Personal Data Required:</strong> We do not ask for your name, email, or other identifiers beyond the Order ID, as the App operates anonymously.

        <h3>4. Limitations</h3>
        - <strong>Non-Transferable:</strong> Purchases are tied exclusively to your Google Play account and cannot be transferred to another account, device not linked to that account, or different platform.<br>
        - <strong>Google Dependency:</strong> Restoration relies on Google Play’s systems. We cannot restore purchases if Google Play fails to verify them due to reasons beyond our control (e.g., account issues, policy violations).<br>
        - <strong>No Refunds via Restoration:</strong> Restoring purchases reactivates access but does not affect refund eligibility. Refund requests must be directed to Google Play ([Google Play Refund Policy Link]).<br>
        - <strong>Anonymous System:</strong> Since we do not maintain user accounts or store purchase data on our servers, restoration is entirely managed by Google Play Services.

        <h3>5. Post-Restoration</h3>
        - Successfully restored purchases will reactivate your premium features or content within the App.<br>
        - If you uninstall and reinstall the App, the process must be repeated to restore purchases, as we do not retain any data linking you to prior usage.

        <h2>Important Notes</h2>
        - <strong>Anonymous Usage:</strong> [Your App Name] does not require or use email-based accounts, personal logins, or traditional user profiles. All purchase management is handled through your Google Play account, ensuring your anonymity.<br>
        - <strong>Google Play Responsibility:</strong> Transaction records and purchase verification are maintained by Google Play, not us. For issues beyond restoration (e.g., account deletion or payment disputes), refer to Google’s support ([Google Support Link]).<br>
        - <strong>No Data Collection:</strong> We do not collect or store personal information during the restoration process, aligning with our privacy-first design.

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        For optional assistance with purchase restoration, email us at:<br>
        <strong>Email:</strong> cosmicloopbyte@gmail.com<br>
        Please include only your Google Play Order ID and a brief issue description. We do not require or collect additional personal details and will respond within 5 business days. Contact is not mandatory—most restorations occur automatically via the App.
