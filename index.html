    <title>Account Deletion Policy - [Your App Name]</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Account Deletion Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This Account Deletion Policy is part of the broader privacy practices for [Your App Name], effective as of February 21, 2025. It outlines the process for requesting the deletion of any data associated with your use of the App. Since [Your App Name] operates with an anonymous registration system and stores all user-generated data locally on your device, this policy reflects our commitment to minimal data handling. Please review this carefully.

        <h2>Account Deletion Request</h2>
        At [Your App Name], we prioritize user privacy and anonymity. The App does not require account creation, login credentials, or personal information such as email addresses or names. All interactions are anonymous, and conversations are stored solely on your device. However, if you have made in-app purchases or wish to disassociate any minimal technical data linked to your usage, you may request deletion as outlined below.

        <h3>1. Submit an Account Deletion Request</h3>
        Since the App uses an anonymous system, "account deletion" refers to the removal of any purchase-related or technical data tied to your Google Play account. To initiate this process:<br>
        - <strong>Uninstall the App:</strong> Simply uninstalling [Your App Name] from your device will delete all locally stored data, including chat history, as we do not retain any of this information on our servers.<br>
        - <strong>Contact Us (Optional):</strong> If you have made in-app purchases and want to ensure related data is disassociated, send a request to:<br>
        <strong>Email Address:</strong> cosmicloopbyte@gmail.com<br>
        Subject Line: "Account Deletion Request - [Your App Name]"

        <h3>2. Request Details</h3>
        As the App does not collect personal information or assign traditional User IDs, we do not require your name or email for identification. If you choose to contact us regarding in-app purchases, please provide:<br>
        - <strong>Google Play Order ID (if applicable):</strong> Found in your purchase confirmation email or Google Play transaction history. This allows us to identify and disassociate any purchase records.<br>
        - <strong>Additional Context (optional):</strong> Approximate date of purchase or installation to assist us in processing your request.<br>
        Note: If you have not made purchases, uninstalling the App is sufficient, and no further action is needed.

        <h3>3. Deletion Process</h3>
        - <strong>Local Data Deletion:</strong> Uninstalling the App immediately removes all conversations and in-app content stored on your device via Room database. We have no access to this data and cannot retain or delete it on your behalf.<br>
        - <strong>Purchase or Technical Data Deletion:</strong> If you submit a request regarding in-app purchases:<br>
          - <strong>Processing Time:</strong> We will process your request within 5 business days. In rare cases of high demand or technical delays, this may extend to 15 business days. A confirmation email will be sent upon completion.<br>
          - <strong>Verification:</strong> We may verify your request using the Google Play Order ID to ensure accuracy. No personal information is required.<br>
        - <strong>No Server Data:</strong> Since we do not store user data on our servers, the deletion process is limited to purchase records or anonymized technical data accessible via Google Play Services.

        <h3>4. Data Affected by Deletion</h3>
        Given our anonymous and local storage approach, the following applies:<br>
        - <strong>Locally Stored Data:</strong> Chat history and other content stored on your device are deleted upon uninstallation. This is entirely under your control, as we do not collect or access this data.<br>
        - <strong>In-App Purchase Records:</strong> If you made purchases, we will disassociate any related transaction data (e.g., premium feature access) linked to your Google Play account that we can access.<br>
        - <strong>Technical Data:</strong> Minimal anonymized data (e.g., crash logs, app version usage) collected via Google Play Services will be deleted or disassociated where possible.

        <h3>5. Data Retention Period</h3>
        - <strong>Local Data:</strong> No retention occurs, as all data cihazda tutulur ve uninstall ile silinir.<br>
        - <strong>Purchase/Technical Data:</strong> Upon processing a deletion request, any relevant data may be retained for up to 30 days to comply with accounting or technical reconciliation needs. After this period, it is permanently deleted.<br>
        - <strong>Legal Obligations:</strong> In exceptional cases, purchase records may be retained longer if required by law (e.g., tax regulations in Turkey or Google Play policies). Such data will be anonymized and used solely for compliance purposes.

        <h3>6. Post-Deletion</h3>
        - Uninstalling the App removes all local data instantly.<br>
        - If you requested purchase data deletion, premium features will no longer be accessible unless repurchased.<br>
        - Reinstalling the App starts a fresh, anonymous session with no prior data retained.

        <h2>Important Notes</h2>
        - <strong>Anonymous Usage:</strong> [Your App Name] does not use email-based accounts or collect personal data. Thus, "account deletion" is limited to purchase or technical data disassociation and local data removal via uninstallation.<br>
        - <strong>Google Play Data:</strong> Transaction records may remain in your Google Play account, managed by Google. To delete these, follow Googleâ€™s account deletion process ([Google Account Deletion Link]).<br>
        - <strong>No Reversibility:</strong> Deletion is permanent. Reinstallation creates a new, unlinked experience.

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        For assistance with purchase-related deletion requests or questions about this policy, email us at:<br>
        <strong>Email:</strong> cosmicloopbyte@gmail.com<br>
        We aim to respond within 5 business days. Note: Contact is optional and only necessary for purchase-related requests.

        <h2>Hosting This Policy</h2>
        This policy is publicly accessible and may be linked in the Google Play Store listing for [Your App Name]. You can host it via a Google Docs link or a website, ensuring it is available to all users.

        Thank you for using [Your App Name]. We are dedicated to maintaining your privacy through our anonymous, user-focused design.
