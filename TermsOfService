        - <strong>1.1 Purpose:</strong> [Your App Name] is an entertainment application designed to provide users with friendly, romantic conversations via an artificial intelligence (AI) companion. The App does not facilitate interactions between real users; all communication is with the AI.<br>

        - <strong>2.2 Legal Capacity:</strong> You must have the legal capacity to agree to these Terms under the laws of your jurisdiction. No personal identification is required to confirm this; your use of the App implies acceptance.<br>
        - <strong>2.3 Anonymous Access:</strong> The App does not use accounts, logins, or personal data for access. Eligibility is based solely on your voluntary compliance with these Terms.

        <h2>3. License to Use</h2>

          - Use the App for any illegal, harmful, or unauthorized purpose.<br>
          - Attempt to interfere with the App’s functionality or security features.<br>
        - <strong>3.3 No Account Linkage:</strong> As the App operates anonymously, this license is not tied to a user account or personal identifier.

        - <strong>4.1 Lawful Use:</strong> You agree to use the App only for lawful purposes and in compliance with applicable local, national, and international laws.<br>
        - <strong>4.2 Conduct:</strong> Since interactions are limited to the AI, you are responsible for ensuring your usage does not attempt to exploit or misuse the App’s intended functionality (e.g., attempting to bypass AI limitations).<br>
        - <strong>4.3 No Data Submission:</strong> The App does not collect user-generated content beyond locally stored conversations, which remain on your device. You are not required to submit personal data to us.

        <h2>5. In-App Purchases</h2>
        - <strong>5.1 Availability:</strong> The App offers optional in-app purchases (e.g., premium features, subscriptions) processed exclusively through Google Play.<br>
        - <strong>5.2 Payment Terms:</strong> All transactions are final and non-refundable except as mandated by applicable law or Google Play’s refund policy. Prices may change without notice.<br>
        - <strong>5.3 Management:</strong> Purchases are linked to your Google Play account, not to any personal account within the App, as we do not maintain user profiles.<br>
        - <strong>5.4 Restoration:</strong> To restore purchases, refer to the Restore Purchases Policy. No personal data is required for this process.<br>
        - <strong>5.5 Taxes:</strong> You are responsible for any applicable taxes related to your purchases, managed through Google Play.

        - <strong>6.1 Ownership:</strong> The App, including its AI, design, text, and graphics, is owned by [Your Name/App Name] and protected by copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws worldwide.<br>
        - <strong>6.2 User Feedback:</strong> Any feedback or suggestions you provide voluntarily (e.g., via email) may be used by us without compensation or obligation. No personal data is required or linked to such feedback.<br>
        - <strong>6.3 No User Content:</strong> As conversations are stored locally and not transmitted to us, you retain no ownership rights over content within the App beyond your device.

        <h2>7. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        - <strong>7.1 As-Is Basis:</strong> The App is provided "as is" and "as available," without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular purpose, merchantability, or non-infringement.<br>
