    <p>
        This Account Deletion Policy is part of the broader privacy practices for <strong>Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text</strong>, effective as of <strong>February 21, 2025</strong>.

        At <strong>Elera AI: Chat, Talk, Text</strong>, we prioritize user privacy and secure account management.

However, certain data, such as account linking information and purchase records, may be stored on our servers. This policy details how to request the deletion of your account and associated data.
