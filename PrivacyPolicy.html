    <h1>Account Deletion Policy</h1>
    <p>
        This Account Deletion Policy is part of the broader privacy practices for <strong>ChatVibe: My AI Friend</strong>, effective as of <strong>February 21, 2025</strong>.

    <h2>Account Deletion Request</h2>
    <p>
        At <strong>ChatVibe: My AI Friend</strong>, we prioritize user privacy and secure account management. The app requires users to log in via their Google accounts, and all user-generated data (e.g., chat history) is stored locally on your device. However, certain data, such as account linking information and purchase records, may be stored on our servers. This policy details how to request the deletion of your account and associated data.
    </p>
